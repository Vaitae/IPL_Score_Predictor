# IPL Cricket Score Predictor

An interactive deep learning-based IPL Score Predictor built using historical match data. This project predicts IPL match scores based on user input, such as venue, batting team, bowling team, striker, and bowler. The model is developed using a neural network and optimized with Huber loss, and the interface is built using **ipywidgets** for a seamless user experience.
